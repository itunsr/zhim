　　我没去那间老屋看小女儿，不会去的。可她跑出家门身上分文没有，靠什么生活呢？
　　或许是匆匆的缘份，或许是注定来而复去的瞬间永恒，再或许是对胆小被动的悔恨惩罚。总之，我和你——擦肩而过了。
到湖一看，湖面宁静，很遥远才有一片荡漾，湖水清绿，看不见底，湖鸭也不知都飞到哪去了，城中喇叭声听得井井有条。
In the world of mortals, we pass by, to the end, the scenery of who is who?
I only know that "when we distance is no longer distance, we will meet, as water, ice, condensed, or turn into dust", I hope you are my most beautiful scenery, I am you have waited for a long time in. Hey, why so?
Good wishes always arrive but the reality of life.
Will the long cold nights will be over, the good life is here.
"If winter comes, can spring be far behind?"
Might as well have a relaxed, bearing a calm heart.
The treasure of the treasure, the to let go is to let go of, don't do sauvignon blanc, empty waiting his sleep.
If the will all see light, the dissension on earth there is nothing can make us.
, of course, it doesn't matter after all the fate is not he who sees through the world of mortals, more is not in the game of life, nothing seek but weak in training a great feelings, had a precious peace, even if our life is not pure like a month, it might as well give yourself an open spirit home.
Ah, edge, edge water!
What is done cannot be undone, what's more, the fate?
Life in hand, not demanding vigorous, little guilty, but beg quiet such as poetry, light such as song.
I always let in the endless CARES about your endless thoughts.
In the cold moonlight your indifference, splendid sunshine smile, lonely light rain in the miss you the blue, and yellow leaves of vivid, the flying days miss you in my life, you are the most in a more, although I know it is a failure, but I still feel that love you is not wrong, just missed the season.
